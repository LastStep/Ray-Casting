This project implements a simple neural network that evolves using a genetic algorithm. It consists of:

Neural Network: Processes input data and learns through feedforward and backpropagation.
Mutation: Introduces random changes to the networkâ€™s weights to explore new solutions.
Genetic Algorithm: Selects the best-performing networks and creates a new generation by copying and mutating them.
